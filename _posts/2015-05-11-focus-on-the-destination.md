I always thought that it was the biggest bullshit when people told me that I have the choice and power to choose the easiest path in life. Sure I could craft the path to make it seem like it is the most simple path, but you will never know whether or not the path you took is the easiest.

Something inside of me always flinched when people told me that there are multiple paths in life: of course there are.

What’s important is differentiating whether or not the path you are taking will lead you to the destination.

Life as a design student 
---
After graduating high school, I had no hope in getting accepted to architecture school. I was bad at theory and definitely wasn’t the brightest when it came down to drawing.

But there I was, graduating class of 2016 accepted into John H. Daniels School of Architecture at the University of Toronto [U of T]. Like every other student I was scared, nervous, and burdened. Scared because I had lived in Edmonton for 18 years of my life under the household of my family. Nervous because I heard terrifying stories about how U of T is the Harvard of Canada. And finally, burdened because I have the expectation of being successful by my parents.

I’m not going to lie, the first year of university was one of the best years of my life. I met a lot of friends, experienced a lot, and learned a lot about the world. I was enjoying the classes I was taking and had a decent GPA.

But I dropped out.

Although everything in Toronto was going better than planned, the path of architecture was not fulfilling enough. First, I didn’t want to spend 8, maybe 10 years of my life in an institution slaving away at academia and studio projects. Second, I just didn’t know enough about the world. After dropping out of architecture school I took my hand something somewhat similar. I attended a technical private school (*goodbye money*) to study graphic design. It wasn’t until I entered that school where I found tech. Graphic design was fun to be honest, but it was something I was familiar with. I wanted to challenge myself.

After graduating with my diploma in web design, I landed an internship at an amazing company called LemonStand.

Working there was both the worst and best experiences.





Starting from zero

Working at a startup is hard, especially a smaller sized one. It’s not a job, it’s a lifestyle. If you don’t know something, you are expected to learn it. Some of the hardest times for me working at LemonStand was when the CEO would come and tell me to do tasks that I didn’t learn about at all. *cough* support tickets *cough*.

It wasn’t until I messed up that I realized the way I was living my life was mainly about focusing on the path and not the destination.

I looked for jobs and did interviews during work hours… and I got caught (**I know that was dumb**). Essentially, my efforts weren’t in helping the company grow. I was trying to change my path in something that might only have lasted in the short-term.

My CEO after a long talk understood my position and gave me another chance (You’re the best Danny). After almost getting fired for doing something hideous, I realized that I tunnel visioned on only the path. All I thought about were questions like: Why can’t I do the things I want at this company? Why does it feel like I’m not contributing to the company’s success? Why am I getting treated so poorly?

Getting to hero

The next 3 months working at LemonStand were like a dream. I actually enjoyed doing support tasks and getting into work everyday. I started looking at my internship differently. To me, the internship was an opportunity for growth and that’s exactly what I got. The mistakes that I made were valuable lessons that I will never forget.

All of the experiences that I made at LemonStand really helped me shape my identity.

The takeaway
---
What is my destination? I don’t know, I’m not in it right now. I still have a lot of paths that I need to explore and have a lot of “dream destinations” that I want to go to.

The most important thing is that once you reach your destination you look back to the various paths you took and are proud of where you are now. If you are not happy with where you are currently, keep going. Go on a new journey if you are not fulfilled with your current destination. Don’t be afraid of failure, and definitely don’t let the world hold you down when exploring life. If the path you are currently on is tough and makes you want to turn around, don’t.

And back to my first point: how to choose the right path. All the paths are the right paths. No matter what path you take, make sure that the path itself doesn’t hinder you on your journey to your destination. What matters is the destination, not the journey.
