description: "You Learn by Failing"

*Preface*: I am a young designer who has only worked 2 startup jobs. One at <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/" target="_blank">EventMobi</a> as a Product Designer (Pseudo PM) and another at <a href="https://lemonstand.com" target="_blank">LemonStand</a> as a UI/UX Designer - Both being internships. 

A lot of these lessons will probably be familiar to you. If they are, simply read them as reminders. 

Nothing Ventured is Nothing Gained
---
This is the biggest takeaway for me as a young designer in the tech world. If I ever felt that there was something that the company or I needed, I wouldn’t be afraid to approach the right people. There really is nothing to be afraid of when pitching new ideas.

A list of things that got rejected and approved:

- A re-design for the company website - **Approved**
- A new design process to solve communication errors - **Rejected**
- Implementing a weekly UX testing call with users - **Rejected**
- Asking for a product manager role in the company - **Approved**
- Buying a 10ft basketball net for the office - **Rejected**
- Chipotle Wednesdays - **Obviously Approved**

<br>
The one thing you should know is that if something get’s rejected, you shouldn’t take that to heart. There is a reason as to why it got rejected. If it did, continue to find a way to get your idea approved.

There's more to the job than your job title

My job title was along the lines of “intern designer”. While working in tech my job title meant a lot more than the description. I was treated the same as everybody else on the team and therefore was expected to do some of the tasks that everybody else had on their plate.

Some of the things that were not related to my job title: 

+	Learning how to do motion graphics in Apple Keynote and making a marketing video strictly on Keynote. *This was a struggle but was fun nonetheless.*
+	Jumping from team to team. I was on engineering one day, then the next I was sitting with marketing helping them with a new eBook design they were working on.
+	Working from project to project. One day you might be doing some designs for the new product, the next you’ll be doing some set up calls because half of the team is on vacation.
+	Doing Dishes

The person you are talking to matters more than you
---
This is a general life lesson that I learned. I’ve been to quite a few networking events and I would say 9/10 events I don’t get a follow-up email from someone. It wasn’t until recently I realized that being a great conversationalist isn’t about how many good stories you can tell, but it’s about how many stories you can get the other person to share.

When talking to someone, be sincere, don’t criticize, and definitely don’t condemn. I have a fear in starting up a conversation but there’s one opener question that always catches someone off guard: “What is the best thing that happened to you today?”. This is guaranteed to work (don’t sue me please), not only is it an open-ended question, it brings out the interesting fact about the person you are talking to at the same time if you are lucky. After you get the essential information, then you can guide the conversation to be meaningful.

Meetings are expensive, so you better be prepared
---
As a designer, I was asked to hold a design ideation meeting with all of the stakeholder’s of the company (Sales manager, CTO, CEO, Engineering Team Leads, and Product Managers). This was scheduled to be a 2 hour meeting… which amounts to a large sum of money. The meeting went well, sort of. I made a couple of jokes at the beginning and people laughed, it wasn’t until the CEO stopped the meeting 30 minutes in and walked out of it when I realized that I made a mistake.

What went wrong: 

- Only half of the people in the room understood what the objectives of the meeting were. I didn’t explain well enough at the beginning.
- I didn’t ask the people in the meeting to bring ideas or to do some research prior to the meeting. I thought 2 hours was enough for an ideation meeting… it’s not.
- I wasn’t experienced in holding big meetings. I should have sit in one before I led one.
