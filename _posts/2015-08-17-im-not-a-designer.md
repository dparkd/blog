If you are reading this and you know me personally, then you know that I don't get angry easily. I'm not saying I'm an angel that fell from the sky, but what I'm trying to say is that there's a lot of things that don't make sense when you get angry. 

Are you really mad?

If you ever have the time, take a step back and just spectate someone getting angry and take note of their actions, words, and facial expressions - It's really funny. It's funny because you are not the one who's involved. (Remember this point, it's very important). 

There's probably two reasons why you become angry:

+ *Someone did/said something that hurt your pride*
+ *Someone did/said something that goes against your personal beliefs*

<br>

Do you remember that point I made? You get angry because someone else did something to upset <strong>your</strong> standards, not theirs. 

Heat of the moment

I like to think of anger as a short-term thing. Anger is like a candle - Once it's lit it has the power and all eyes are drawn to it, but once the flame is gone all that's left is a burnt wick. 

I won't argue with you in saying that being angry feels good. It get's you undivided attention and grants you power. The one thing you should be aware of though is that it's momentary. 

-- Im not saying you should be a push over and just stand there when people are doing things wrong, I'm saying to take a step back first, look at all the variables, and if it's something you still think is worth to get angry for then do it. Whenever you're angry you are short sighted, the next time you feel some frustration try to say these words first: "How does the other person feel?"
